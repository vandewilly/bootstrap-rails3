Rails 3, RSpec, Cucumber, Haml, and jQuery
==============================================

Easily generate a Rails 3 RC application with RSpec, Cucumber, Haml, YUI css, Jammit and jQuery in one line:

    % rails new my_app -J -T -d mysql -m http://github.com/jgeiger/rails3-app/raw/master/app_template.rb

rvm
---

We love `rvm`, so the application has an `.rvmrc` generated to specify a gemset.


git
---

We love `git`, so the application has a git repo initialized with all the initial changes staged.

Wrap Up
-------

After the application has been generated, there are a few final command to finish the install, check the output!
